  <h1>Getting Started with Lua Programming</h1>

  <p>Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It is widely used in game development, embedded systems, and as a scripting language in various applications. Despite its simplicity, Lua offers advanced features, making it a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers alike.</p>

  <h2>Why Lua?</h2>
  <p>Lua is known for being small, fast, and flexible. Some of its key features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Lua is designed to be simple and efficient, making it a great choice for embedded systems and low-level applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensible:</strong> Lua can be easily embedded into applications, and it can be extended with C or C++ libraries.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy to Learn:</strong> Lua has a simple syntax and is very easy to get started with, even for complete beginners.</li>
    <li><strong>Used in Game Development:</strong> Lua is frequently used in game engines like <em>Love2D</em> and <em>Corona SDK</em>, making it a popular choice for creating games and interactive applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Installing Lua</h2>
  <p>To get started with Lua, you need to install it on your system. Here's how:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Visit the official Lua website: <a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank">https://www.lua.org/</a></li>
    <li>Download the latest version of Lua for your operating system.</li>
    <li>Follow the installation instructions for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
    <li>Verify your installation by opening a terminal and typing:
      <code>lua -v</code> to check the installed version.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Lua Code Example</h2>
  <p>Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" example in Lua:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-lua">
-- This is a simple Lua program
print("Hello, World!")
  </code></pre>
  <p>When you run this code, it will output:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-lua">
Hello, World!
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Basic Lua Concepts</h2>
  <h3>Variables and Data Types</h3>
  <p>In Lua, variables are used to store data. Lua is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. Here are some examples:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-lua">
name = "John"   -- String
age = 25        -- Integer
height = 5.9    -- Float
is_student = true  -- Boolean

print("Name: " .. name)
print("Age: " .. age)
print("Height: " .. height)
print("Is student? " .. tostring(is_student))
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Control Structures</h3>
  <p>Lua provides common control structures like <code>if</code> statements and loops. Here's an example of an <code>if</code> statement:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-lua">
age = 18
if age &gt;= 18 then
    print("You are an adult.")
else
    print("You are a minor.")
end
  </code></pre>

  <p>And here is an example of a <code>for</code> loop in Lua:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-lua">
for i = 1, 5 do
    print("Number: " .. i)
end
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Lua is a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language that is widely used for embedded systems, game development, and scripting. With its simple syntax and powerful features, it is a great choice for developers looking for flexibility and efficiency.</p>

  <p><strong>Happy Coding!</strong> 🚀</p>

<article class="post">
  <h1>Getting Started with Arduino Programming</h1>

  <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on simple software and hardware. It is designed for anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments. Arduino is a great tool for beginners, hobbyists, and even professionals who want to experiment with electronics, sensors, and microcontrollers.</p>

  <h2>Why Arduino?</h2>
  <p>Arduino is popular for its simplicity and ease of use. Some of the key features of Arduino include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Both the hardware and software are open-source, allowing a large community to contribute.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy to Learn:</strong> The Arduino IDE is simple to use, making it accessible to beginners with no prior experience in programming or electronics.</li>
    <li><strong>Large Community:</strong> With millions of users worldwide, Arduino has a massive community, making it easier to find tutorials, projects, and troubleshooting advice.</li>
    <li><strong>Wide Range of Applications:</strong> Arduino can be used for a variety of projects, including robotics, home automation, IoT, and even interactive art installations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Setting Up Arduino</h2>
  <p>Before you can start programming your Arduino board, you'll need to set it up. Follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Install the Arduino IDE:</strong> Download and install the official Arduino IDE from <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank">Arduino's official website</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Connect Your Arduino Board:</strong> Plug your Arduino board (such as an Arduino Uno) into your computer using a USB cable.</li>
    <li><strong>Select the Board and Port:</strong> In the Arduino IDE, go to <code>Tools &gt; Board</code> and select your board type (e.g., Arduino Uno). Then, under <code>Tools &gt; Port</code>, select the port your Arduino is connected to.</li>
    <li><strong>Test Your Setup:</strong> Upload the "Blink" sketch (a built-in example) to make sure everything is working. If your LED on the board blinks, you’re all set!</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Arduino Code Example: Blinking an LED</h2>
  <p>The simplest Arduino program is the "Blink" sketch, which blinks an LED on and off. Here's the code:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-c">
// This is the Blink sketch

// Pin for the LED
int ledPin = 13;

void setup() {
  // Initialize the LED pin as an output
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  // Wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
  delay(1000);
  // Turn the LED off
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  // Wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
  delay(1000);
}
  </code></pre>

  <p>This program does the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It defines pin 13 as the pin connected to the LED (on most Arduino boards, an onboard LED is connected to this pin).</li>
    <li>In the <code>setup()</code> function, the pin is set to <code>OUTPUT</code>.</li>
    <li>The <code>loop()</code> function turns the LED on and off every second (1000 milliseconds).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Basic Arduino Concepts</h2>
  <h3>Variables and Functions</h3>
  <p>Arduino programs are written in C/C++ syntax. You can define variables, functions, and use built-in functions like <code>pinMode()</code>, <code>digitalWrite()</code>, and <code>delay()</code>.</p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-c">
// Define a variable for the LED pin
int ledPin = 13; // Pin 13 is usually where the built-in LED is connected

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // Set the LED pin as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn LED on
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // Turn LED off
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Control Structures</h3>
  <p>Like other programming languages, Arduino supports control structures such as <code>if</code> statements and loops.</p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-c">
// Example of an if statement
int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // Read the value from analog pin A0
if (sensorValue &gt; 512) {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn LED on if the value is greater than 512
} else {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // Turn LED off if the value is less than 512
}
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Arduino is an excellent platform for beginners and experienced developers alike. It provides a hands-on approach to learning programming, electronics, and hardware interaction. Whether you’re building simple projects or complex systems, Arduino gives you the tools to turn your ideas into reality.</p>

  <p><strong>Happy Coding and Building!</strong> 🚀</p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>
